// ==================================== [serialCommunication.h] =============================
/*
*	This library offers some functions to communicate with a device via a serial interface.
*
*	Usage:
*	At first, you have to open a port with the function "openPort(...)".
*	After that, you can send and receive data with the different functions provided.
*	If you have finished all your communication, you can close the port again by calling "closePort()".
*
*	HINT (Linux):
*	On linux, you have to have the correct rights to use the serial interfaces. For example, you
*	can obtain them by starting the program as root, or adding the user, which starts the program,
*	to the group "dialout".
*
*	CAUTION:
*	Opening a port will set the stream-readings to non-blocking. This means, that functions reading
*	data from streams will not wait until a char is received but rather just return zero. You should
*	design you program to properly handle this behaviour, if you plan on leaving ports open.
